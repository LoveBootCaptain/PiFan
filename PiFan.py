# PiFan is a python program to control a fan with a transistor.
# It uses on/ff as well as a kind of voltage regulation by turning the transitor om/of
# very very fast to "modulate" the output voltage.

# please adafruit make an AC motor driver with voltage regulation for venting the pi's from internal 5V !!!
